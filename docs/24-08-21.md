- xll notation: 0.6666666666666666xll

#### Pound (GBP)

- Market rate: 1 pound = 160 yen
- xll notation: 0.625xll

### Cryptocurrencies

- xll notation: 0.00001xll

#### Ethereum (ETH)

- Market rate: 1ETH = 1 million yen

Such notations are possible.
This will be expressed in xll according to real-time market rates.

## Steps for xll system changes

1. Open VSCode:
   - Execute `code xll` in the terminal to open the project

2. Edit the `app/price_fetcher.py` file:
   - Open the file and add or update the `XLL_BASE` constant:

     ```python
     XLL_BASE = 100  # Based on 100 yen
     ```

   - Calculate xll value in the `get_asset_price` function:

     ```python
     xll_value = XLL_BASE / price if price else None
     ```

3. Update the `app/models.py` file:
   - Add `xll_value` column to the `prices` table:

     ```python
     Column("xll_value", Float),
     ```

4. Database migration:
   - Create a new migration file:

     ```bash
     alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add xll_value column"
     ```

   - Apply the migration:

     ```bash
     alembic upgrade head
     ```

5. Update the `app/api/endpoints.py` file:
   - Add `xll_value` to the response of the `/price/{asset_type}/{asset_id}` endpoint
   - Add `xll_value` to the response of the `/prices` endpoint

6. Update the frontend (`app/static/index.html`):
   - Add `xll Value` column to the table
   - Update JavaScript to display xll value

7. Update tests:
   - Add test cases for xll value in `tests/test_api.py`

8. Update documentation:
   - Add explanation of xll to `README.md`
   - Update API specification (Swagger/OpenAPI)

9. Commit changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement xll value representation"
   ```

10. Restart the application:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

11. Verify operation:
    - Access `http://localhost:8000/static/index.html` in the browser
    - Test API endpoints

Note: As this change affects the entire system, ensure thorough testing and gradual deployment.

## Scheduled execution of maintenance script using crontab

1. Open terminal

2. Enter the following command to edit crontab:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

3. If editing crontab for the first time, you may be prompted to choose an editor. Nano editor is usually suitable for beginners.

4. When the editor opens, add a new line:

   ```bash
   0 3 * * * /Users/your_username/xll/venv/bin/python /Users/your_username/xll/app/maintenance.py
   ```

   Note: Adjust the path according to your actual project location.

5. If using nano editor:
   - Press Ctrl + O to save
   - Press Enter to confirm
   - Press Ctrl + X to exit the editor

6. If using vi editor:
   - Press Esc key to enter command mode
   - Type `:wq` and press Enter to save and exit

7. If saved successfully, you'll see the message "crontab: installing new crontab"

8. To verify the settings, run the following command:

   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```

Important points:

- Crontab settings affect the entire system, so proceed with caution.
- Ensure paths are accurate. Using absolute paths is recommended.
- Make sure the script has execution permissions (`chmod +x /path/to/maintenance.py`).
- On Mac, crontab execution may require full disk access permission. In System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access, check the terminal application.
