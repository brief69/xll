# Technical Stack

- Python

## APIs to be used

### For Fiat Currencies

1. Open Exchange Rates API
2. Fixer.io
3. XE Currency Data API

### For Cryptocurrencies

1. CoinGecko API
2. CoinMarketCap API
3. Binance API

## Detailed Requirements

1. Representation of xll:
   - Represent the current market value of each asset as xll
   - Periodic updates of exchange rates and cryptocurrency prices
   - Use the median price data obtained from three APIs for each asset type

2. System Functions:
   - Real-time xll value updates
   - Comparison of xll values between different assets
   - Storage and analysis of historical data

3. Data Integration:
   - Aggregate data from three APIs for each asset type
   - Update data every 5 minutes
   - Calculate the median of the data obtained from the three sources and adopt it as the xll value
   - Data validation and anomaly detection

4. Security Measures:
   - Manage API keys using environment variables
   - Protect data with AES encryption
   - Use HTTPS communication

5. Scalability:
   - Handle large requests with asynchronous processing
   - Use PostgreSQL database

6. User Interface:
   - Develop a web application using Flask
   - Develop a command-line interface

7. Test Plan:
   - Unit tests using unittest
   - Integration and E2E tests using pytest

8. Deployment:
   - Use AWS EC2 and RDS

9. Data Processing:
   - Proper handling of decimal places
   - Implement methods for comparing different assets
   - Normalize data and convert to a unified format

10. Performance Optimization:
    - Efficient data updates and calculations
    - Implement caching strategies
    - Manage API usage limits
    - Handle concurrent requests to the three APIs

11. Error Handling and Recovery:
    - Retry logic for network errors and temporary failures
    - Ensure redundancy of API providers
    - Handle cases where one or two APIs are unavailable (use remaining data)

12. Data Storage and Analysis:
    - Store and analyze historical data
    - Use past data for anomaly detection
    - Record price data from each API source and the adopted median

13. Monitoring and Logging:
    - Constant monitoring of the data acquisition process
    - Detailed logging and analysis functions
    - Monitor price differences between API sources and implement a warning system

14. Optimization of Update Frequency:
    - Adjust update frequency according to the type of asset
    - Properly manage data updates outside trading hours

## Decentralized Architecture

1. Utilization of IPFS:
   - Store xll data on IPFS
   - Ensure data integrity through content addressing
   - Decentralized hosting of the web application

2. Utilization of Blockchain:
   - Record xll data hashes on the blockchain
   - Implement xll calculation logic using smart contracts
